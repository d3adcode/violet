Try typing the following commands to get an idea how violet works.
At any point if you wish to reset to the default state just type 'open <Enter>'.
During this demo, open is hardcoded to load this static file.
Pressing <tab> will attempt to complete the command from your given input.
Pressing <Enter> by itself will repeat the previous command.

>>search myWord --reverse
>>goto end
>>goto lineEnd
>>insert my text
>>next word
>>open
